- Show path/filename of current file
- Save/export button
- Menu strip for load, reload, save
- Button to resize picture
- Color palettes:
    - Other NES palettes
    - Sega palettes
    - SNES palette? Not sure how with color size
    - GB green palette
- Color palette preview
- Color replacement algos:
    - Try to determine what "named" color it is first somehow
        - Maybe weigh R, G and B differently? Instead of comparing the total sum. Could be multiple ways to go about this
        - Same thing with HSV
- Cropping to certain size, so it can be like an actual NES screenshot, etc.
    - Maybe have a cursor in the correct aspect ratio, scaled to the current size
- Methods that require it to be whole image rather than per-pixel:
    - Dithering
    - Get the X most used colors and limit to that amount of colors (i.e. 26 for NES?)
    - Get areas of most diverse color variation. Could be used to detect faces for better crops?
- Inefficiencies/bad code:
    - Selecting the palette is a bit weird
    - Image setting itself to a modified version of itself
    - Somehow not pixel by pixel?
